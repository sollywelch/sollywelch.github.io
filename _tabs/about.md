I began my career as a software developer at an AI healthcare startup, where I contributed to innovative solutions linking blockchain and decentralization with healthcare. This early experience sparked my interest in the intersection of technology and industry, and inspired me to launch my own businesses in software development and consulting. These ventures offered hands-on insights into the power of technology across various sectors, setting the stage for my ongoing journey at IBM.
